# Digit Recognition with Neural Network

A Flask-based web application that uses a TensorFlow neural network to predict handwritten digits (1-9) from images with 97.48% accuracy.

## Features
- Upload a handwritten digit image (1-9).
- Neural network predicts the digit using a pre-trained `.h5` model.
- Built with Flask, TensorFlow, and OpenCV.

## Setup
1. Clone the repository:
